            <p class="lead text-muted">My full name is Montserrat Diaz Marroquin. (One first name, two last names, no middle name). A bit of a mouthful, I am aware, and you will have to roll your r's if you want to get it right. My first name, Montserrat, is of Catalan origin and it mean sawn mount (romantic, isn't it?). I was born in a city called Leon, in the beautiful country of Mexico, on April 4th, 1998. I have lived in Mexico for most of my life but I studied in the United States for roughly seven years. I went to highschool in Norman Oklahoma and uppon graduating I attended the University of Oklahoma. I was majoring in environmental engineering, however, as a result of the pandemic I had to pospone my university studies and return to my hometown in Mexico. Things have not gone according to plan in this past year, however, I took advantage of this unexpected occurance and decided to invest my time and money in learning how to code, which is something I have been wanting to do for a long time. At the beginning of this course I knew close to nothing about coding and, although I still feel pretty lost sometimes, I am astounded by my progress so far. I have learned a lot in the past few months since the course began, and seeing my knowledge reflected in these types of assignments makes me very happy.</p>
